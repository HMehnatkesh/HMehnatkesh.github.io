## Fault Diagnosis of Internal Combustion Engines

This project focuses on functional analysis and fault diagnosis of internal combustion engines during hot testing.
Both **internal faults** (e.g., spark plug gap variations that are not externally observable) and **external system-level
faults** (e.g., cylinder power imbalance) are studied using sensor data and comparative analysis across cylinders.

**Key topics:** engine diagnostics, sensor-based fault detection, cylinder balancing

## Water Detection in a Transparent Fuel Cell Using Deep Neural Networks

Accurate measurement of water coverage inside fuel cells is challenging due to the lack of direct sensing methods and
the absence of explicit water dynamics in standard physical models. In this project, **deep neural networks** are used
to estimate water coverage in a transparent fuel cell, enabling improved efficiency and extended service life.

**Key topics:** deep learning, fuel cell diagnostics, data-driven modeling

## Parallel Parking Training Using Haptic Assist Torque in a Driving Simulator

This project investigates the use of **haptic assist torque** applied to a steering wheel to support novice drivers
during parallel parking maneuvers. The level of assistance is gradually reduced over time, encouraging increased
driver engagement and skill acquisition.

**Key topics:** haptics, driver assistance systems, human–machine interaction
