## Fault diagnosis of internal combustion engines
- Functionally studying the behavior of the engine and its faults during the hot test are our aim. Someof the faults are related to the internal section of the engine, such as the park plug gap, which is notvisible from the outside, and the other section is the external behavior of the system, such as balancedpower and sufficient comparison in each cylinder.

## Detection of water in a transparent fuel cell use of a DNN
- There is no tool to make measure water in a fuel cell and its magnitude does not exist in a system ofequations to determine the amount of water available to increase efficiency and service life.

## Parallel park training use of haptic torque in the driving simulator
- A haptic assist torque is applied to a steering wheel for aiding driving trainees during parallel parking.The share of haptic assist torque is gradually reduced and the traineeâ€™s involvement increases.

## Designing, building, controlling, and analyzing an inverted pendulum
- Control of one degree of freedom reverse pendulum with the PID controller (Use of the IMU sensor), emotional control.

## Modeling, controlling, and analyzing a quadcopter with MATLAB
- Model-based control design with the aid of MATLAB and Arduino for a quadcopter.

## Simulation and modeling nonlinear dynamic systems
- Simulation and modeling of nonlinear systems with the aid of analytical dynamics methods such asLagrange, Modified Lagrange, Augmented, Elimination, Embedding, and Greenwood methods in theAnalytical Dynamics course.

## Control of PEM fuel cell with the aid of a nonlinear and fuzzy controller
- Sliding mode, feedback linearization, gain scheduling and PID controller have been developed for thissystem to increase the service life. Furthermore, supervisor fuzzy-PID, fuzzy sliding mode, and trial anderror fuzzy-controller have been developed too. Finally, we combined metaheuristic and heuristicoptimization with traditional methods.
