## Hi, I'm Hossein

I’m a PhD researcher at the University of Alberta working on **machine learning–based modeling and control for hydrogen-assisted engines and energy systems**. My work bridges **control theory (MPC/NMPC)** and **data-driven modeling (deep learning, system identification)** with a strong focus on **real-time deployment, safety constraints, and experimental validation**.

My goal is to develop reliable control strategies that enable **higher hydrogen utilization**, **lower emissions**, and **stable combustion** under practical operating limits.

## Research focus

My research centers on learning-enabled control for complex nonlinear systems, especially combustion and energy applications:

- **Machine learning–enhanced NMPC** (learning models for prediction + constraint-aware control)
- **Real-time, cycle-to-cycle optimization** for multi-cylinder combustion stability and homogeneity
- **Data-driven & physics-informed modeling** (e.g., LSTM-based predictors and hybrid models)
- **Safety- and emissions-aware control** (stability constraints, abnormal combustion prevention)
- **Experimental validation** on engine test platforms

## Collaboration

I’m interested in collaborating on projects related to:

- Learning-based MPC / safe RL for real systems  
- Control-oriented ML modeling (hybrid / physics-informed)  
- Energy, engines, and complex nonlinear dynamical systems
