## Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering 
- September 2023 - Present  
*University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada*  
Thesis: **Machine Learning-Based Modeling and Control of Hydrogen/Diesel Dual-Fuel Engines for Emissions Reduction and Safety Enhancement**   
Advisors: Bob Koch, David Gordon   
Overall GPA: 4 / 4   
Summary: My PhD delivers one of the experimental demonstrations of machine-learning-enhanced predictive control for hydrogen/diesel dual-fuel (HDDF) engines, bridging real hardware, safety-critical constraints, and advanced control theory. My research objective is to develop safe, interpretable, and real-time machine-learning-enabled control frameworks for complex energy and dynamical systems, with a focus on HDDF engines. By bridging physics-based modeling, data-driven learning, and optimal control, I aim to enable reliable, low-emission operation in safety-critical, real-world applications.
