## Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering  
**September 2023 – Present**  
*University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada*

**Thesis:**  
**Machine Learning-Based Modeling and Control of Hydrogen/Diesel Dual-Fuel Engines for Emissions Reduction and Safety Enhancement**

**Advisors:** Bob Koch, David Gordon  
**Overall GPA:** 4.0 / 4.0  

**Summary:**  
My PhD research provides one of the experimental demonstrations of **machine learning–enhanced nonlinear model predictive control** for **hydrogen/diesel dual-fuel (HDDF) engines**, explicitly addressing real-time implementation, safety-critical constraints, and multi-cylinder combustion variability. The work integrates **physics-based modeling**, **data-driven learning**, and **optimal control** to enable reliable, low-emission operation in practical engine systems. The broader objective is to develop **safe, interpretable, and deployable learning-enabled control frameworks** for complex energy and dynamical systems.
