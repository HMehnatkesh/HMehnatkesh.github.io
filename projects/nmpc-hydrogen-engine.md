title: Learning-Based NMPC for Hydrogen–Diesel Engines
permalink: /projects/nmpc-hydrogen-engine/
toc: true
---

## Overview

This project focuses on the development of **machine learning–enhanced nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC)**
for **hydrogen–diesel dual-fuel engines**, with the goal of improving combustion stability,
reducing emissions, and maximizing hydrogen utilization under real-time constraints.

---

## Motivation

Hydrogen-assisted combustion introduces strong nonlinearities, cycle-to-cycle variability,
and safety-critical constraints that challenge conventional control approaches.
This project addresses these challenges by integrating **data-driven prediction models**
within a constrained NMPC framework.

## Methodology

- LSTM-based time-series models for engine output prediction  
- Control-oriented feature selection and preprocessing  
- NMPC formulation with safety, stability, and actuator constraints  
- Real-time optimization and deployment considerations  

---

## Experimental Validation

- Multi-cylinder engine test platform  
- Cycle-to-cycle closed-loop implementation  
- Evaluation metrics: tracking error, combustion stability, constraint violations  

---

## Outputs

- Journal and conference publications  
- MATLAB / Python control and modeling pipeline  
- Experimental datasets (where applicable)
