# About me,

I am Hossein, a control engineer with over 2 years of experience managing projects across the control, automotive, and diagnostics industries. I have strong analytical skills and a deep understanding of mechanical and electrical systems, enabling me to solve unique and complex design and implementation challenges. My research interests are control theories, artificial intelligence, and applied machine learning. As a control engineer with an M.Sc. in Engineering, I specialize in developing, implementing, and deploying control and machine learning solutions for manufacturing processes and fault detection.    
I am currently a PhD candidate at the University of Alberta, where I will apply machine learning control to hydrogen/diesel dual-fuel engines. I am well-versed in programming languages such as MATLAB, Python, and LabVIEW, and I have hands-on experience with tools and frameworks, including PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, and OpenCV.   
My goal is to leverage my expertise to advance the automotive industry and machine learning by developing innovative solutions that drive progress.
