# Hi I am Hossein, 

I am a detail-oriented control engineer with over two years of experience managing projects in the control, automotive, and diagnosis industries. I have strong analytical skills and a deep interdisciplinary understanding of mechanical and electrical systems enabling problem-solving for unique and complex challenges in design and implementation. My research interests are control theories, artificial intelligence, and applied machine learning. 

As a Control Engineer and an accomplished M.Sc. in Engineering, my expertise lies in developing, implementing, and deploying Control and Machine Learning solutions to solve manufacturing processes and fault detection. Currently, I am starting my PhD at the University of Alberta, where I will be applying machine learning control to H2/Diesel dual-fuel engines. 

I am well-versed in programming languages like MATLAB, Python, and LabVIEW, and I have hands-on experience with tools and frameworks such as Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, and OpenCV. 

My mission is to utilize my skills and knowledge to further advance the field of automobile and machine learning by creating innovative solutions that drive progress.
